TYPESCRIPT IS A SUPER SET TO THE JAVASCRIPT

    - it adds static typing to javascript
    - js is orginally dyncaically typed
    - const result = add(2, 5); 
        - js automatically know the type here is numebr
        - function does not know what to expect it just expect "oo i am going to recieve two inputs but it does not know what or what type those things are
    
    - we also need type script compiler
    - type script does not run in the broweser
        - type script will be converted js 
        - this compiling will give us the errors we have in our code regarding the types 
        - we get informed about the type errors at that time directly
